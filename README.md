To share information related to the publication: Automated Purification of DNA Origami with SPRI Beads: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.202308776. Below you can find relevant vendor information and materials that you will need for this method to be carried out.

# Materials
SPRI beads (Ampure XP equivalent), we are using this: https://www.magbiogenomics.com/highprep-pcr.html
Eppendorf 1.5 ml
PCR tubes
Your origami samples after folding
80% (v/v) ethanol
Magnetic rack (see below for the 3D prints part)
elution buffer of your choice (the buffer that you would like your structure to be in)

# Method

The image shows the general outline of the protocol.
We recommend you to dilute the folded sample, if not already at, to 100 ul before you start the method.

For the original method follow below
1. Add 80 ul of the (please refer to the publication for the underlying reasons for this volume of beads)
2. Mix the materials thoroughl with pipette
3. Wait for 5 mins
4. Put the tube on the magnetic rack
5. Wait until the solution is clear, the beads will slowly start to pellet at the magnet
6. Use pipette to aspirate the solution without disturbing the beads pellet
7. Add 500 ul of 80% ethanol and aspirate the ethanol afterwards, use small volume pipette to remove droplets of ethanol
8. Add the elution buffer
9. Remove tube from magnetic rack, resuspend the beads with the elution buffer
10. Wait for 5 mins
11. Place the tube back onto the magnetic rack
12. Wait for solution to become clear
13. Aspirate the solution to a PCR tube
14. Run a thermal declump cycle as follow:
